# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of examining or understanding the data and extracting insights or main characteristics of the data.
EDA is generally classified into two methods, i.e. graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis.

EDA is very essential because it is a good practice to first understand the problem statement and the various relationships between the data features before getting 
our hands dirty.
