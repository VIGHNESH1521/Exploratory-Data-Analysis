- Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of examining or understanding the data and extracting insights or main characteristics of the data.
- EDA is generally classified into two methods, i.e. graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis.
- EDA is very essential because it is a good practice to first understand the problem statement and the various relationships between the data features before getting 
our hands dirty.

The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.

- EDA makes it simple to comprehend the structure of a dataset, making data modelling easier. 
- The primary goal of EDA is to make data ‘clean’ implying that it should be devoid of redundancies. 
- It aids in identifying incorrect data points so that they may be readily removed and the data cleaned. Furthermore, it aids us in comprehending the relationship between the variables, providing us with a broader view of the data and allowing us to expand on it by leveraging the relationship between the variables.
-  It also aids in the evaluation of the dataset’s statistical measurements.
- Outliers or abnormal occurrences in a dataset can have an impact on the accuracy of machine learning models.
- The dataset might also contain some missing or duplicate values. EDA may be used to eliminate or resolve all of the dataset’s undesirable qualities.
