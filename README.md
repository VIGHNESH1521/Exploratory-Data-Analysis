- Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of examining or understanding the data and extracting insights or main characteristics of the data.
- EDA is generally classified into two methods, i.e. graphical analysis and non-graphical analysis.
- EDA is very essential because it is a good practice to first understand the problem statement and the various relationships between the data features before getting 
our hands dirty.
