Uber is an international company located in 69 countries and around 900 cities around the world. Lyft, on the other hand, operates in approximately 644 cities in the US and 12 cities in Canada alone. However, in the US, it is the second-largest passenger company with a market share of 31%.

The day-to-day effect of rising prices varies depending on the location and pair of the Origin-Destination (OD pair) of the Uber trip: at accommodations/train stations, daylight hours can affect the rising price; for theaters, the hour of the important or famous play will affect the prices; finally, attractively, the price hike may be affected by certain holidays, which will increase the number of guests and perhaps even the prices; Finally, at airports, the price of escalation will be affected by the number of periodic flights and certain weather conditions, which could prevent more flights to land and land.

The weather is likely to have a significant impact on the rise in prices of Uber fares and airports as a starting point, as departure and accommodation of aircraft depending on the weather at that time. Different weather conditions will certainly affect the price increase in different ways and at different levels: we assume that weather conditions such as clouds or clearness do not have the same effect on inflation prices as weather conditions such as snow or fog. As for the day of the week, one thing that really matters is to distinguish between weekends and weekends: people often engage in different activities, go to different places, and maintain a different way of traveling during weekends and weekends
